## ResearchPulse FAQ

<details>
<summary>What is ResearchPulse?</summary>

ResearchPulse is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of research impact assessment use case studies, specifically for health and medical research. It applies the Research Impact Assessment Framework (RIAF) to evaluate research environments and their influence within a specific research ecosystem. The tool generates detailed use cases documenting research impact, aiding funding organizations in assessing specific research programs and their outcomes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does ResearchPulse work?</summary>

ResearchPulse employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It retrieves data from various sources like academic databases (PubMed, arXiv, Semantic Scholar), web content via Bing Search API, local documents, and structured health data catalogs. It then processes this information through a context engine, vector index, query engine, and review system. Finally, it generates a comprehensive research impact assessment report with references.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the key features and benefits of using ResearchPulse?</summary>

ResearchPulse offers a range of features including automated generation of use case studies, data processing from multiple sources, customisable research indicators, multi-format report generation, and a user-friendly web interface. The benefits include a systematic and structured approach to research impact assessment, saving time and resources, and providing evidence-based analysis to support funding decisions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I get started with ResearchPulse?</summary>

You can access ResearchPulse through a hosted web interface or by installing it locally. Currently the web app requires a university network connection and login. Local installation requires a Python environment, API keys, and university network access. Detailed instructions for both methods are available in the documentation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of output does ResearchPulse generate?</summary>

ResearchPulse generates a downloadable zip file containing multiple outputs designed to ensure complete documentation and transparency. At its core, you'll receive a detailed research impact report available in both Word and Markdown formats, accompanied by context analysis documentation that details the research environment. The system also preserves individual answers for each assessment question, including both draft and final versions, allowing you to track the development of the assessment.
To support transparency and verification, the package includes all source documents used in the analysis, along with a structured table of any documents that couldn't be automatically accessed (tracked in missing_documents.xlsx).
For process validation and reproducibility, the system provides detailed logs tracking all system operations and AI process steps. All documents are exported in accessible formats, and a record of input settings ensures the assessment process can be reviewed or repeated if needed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I customise the research impact assessment criteria?</summary>

Yes, ResearchPulse offers multiple customisation options to ensure your impact assessment aligns with your specific research context. Users can define custom time periods for both research activity and impact measurement, allowing for precise temporal analysis. The system's flexible framework enables you to select and prioritise relevant research indicators, whether you're focusing on academic impact, societal benefits, or economic outcomes.
You can tailor the assessment criteria to align with your research goals and funding requirements, including specific institutional or grant body frameworks. This customisation extends to language style preferences, helping you generate reports that match your intended audience's expectations. The system also allows you to incorporate additional context through supplementary documentation and custom indicators, ensuring your unique research narrative is accurately captured.

<details>
<summary>How does ResearchPulse ensure responsible AI practices and ethical use?</summary>
ResearchPulse implements several key measures to ensure responsible AI use and ethical data handling. At its core, the system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground all outputs in verifiable sources, ensuring that generated content is consistently backed by evidence. This approach is reinforced by a multi-stage review process that validates the accuracy of all assessments.
To address potential biases, ResearchPulse integrates multiple diverse data sources and employs intelligent filtering mechanisms. The system maintains a human-in-the-loop review process, allowing researchers to validate and customise assessment criteria based on their specific field and requirements.
Transparency and accountability are maintained through extensive process documentation and logging. Data sources are clearly attributed, ensuring users can trace any claim to its origin.
Regarding security and user control, ResearchPulse operates within strict network security restrictions and processes only publicly available research data. Users maintain control over input parameters and can observe how outputs are generated, ensuring transparency throughout the assessment process.
We continuously evaluate and improve these measures through user feedback and systematic monitoring, ensuring that responsible AI principles remain central to ResearchPulse's development and operation.

<details>
<summary>What are the future development plans?</summary>

Future development plans include enhanced security features like SSO integration and private cloud deployment options, integration of international health data catalogs and media impact scoring, and expansion to other research domains beyond health and medical research.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I contribute to development or report issues?</summary>
All development activities and issue reporting are managed through a GitHub repository at the University of Sydney. Users with access can contribute to the project and report issues or feature requests through the repository's issue tracker.
