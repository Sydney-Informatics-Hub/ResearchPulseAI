# AI-driven Research Impact Assessment Tool and Case Study Generator for NSW Health

## Introduction
To measure health and medical research impact, a new Research Impact Assessment Framework (RIAF) has been developed. The RIAF evaluates the research environment and the alignment and influence of research, with the goal of providing funders a holistic analysis of NSW’s health and medical research ecosystem for making informed investment decisions.

To improve the scalability of this framework, an AI powered software has been developed that allows researchers and funding organisations to generate assessment reports about the research impact for a given research group and topic. Research impact is evaluated along distinct criteria such as overall problem addressed, research impact-to-date, and potential future applications. The current design of the case study template includes four assessment criteria and provides researchers the freedom to use a set of indicators that are relevant to their research program.

The AI generator combines Large Language Models (LLM) with factual knowledge retrievers such as scholar publications and web content.
