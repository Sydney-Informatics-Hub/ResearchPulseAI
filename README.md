## ResearchPulse FAQ

<details>
<summary>What is ResearchPulse?</summary>

ResearchPulse is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of research impact assessment use case studies, specifically for health and medical research. It applies the Research Impact Assessment Framework (RIAF) to evaluate research environments and their influence within a specific research ecosystem. The tool generates detailed use cases documenting research impact, aiding funding organizations in assessing specific research programs and their outcomes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does ResearchPulse work?</summary>

ResearchPulse employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It retrieves data from various sources like academic databases (PubMed, arXiv, Semantic Scholar), web content via Bing Search API, local documents, and structured health data catalogs. It then processes this information through a context engine, vector index, query engine, and review system. Finally, it generates a comprehensive research impact assessment report with references.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the key features and benefits of using ResearchPulse?</summary>

ResearchPulse offers a range of features including:
- Automated generation of use case studies
- Data processing from multiple sources
